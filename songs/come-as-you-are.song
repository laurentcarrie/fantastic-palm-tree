\lyrics
Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest as a friend as an old memoria
Memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria
\
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend as an old memoria, memoria, memoria
\
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
Memori-a, memori-a, memoria, memoria
\
And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
