\lyrics
{couplet}
\
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day,
fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way,
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown,
waiting  for someone or something to show you the way.
\
{refrain}
\
[D7M;Ti]red of lying in the sunshine,[A7M;stay]ing home to watch the rain,
you are young and life is long,and there is time to kill today.
[D7M; ]And then one day,you find, [C#m7; ] ten years have got behind you.
[Bm7;No] one told you when to [E;run], You missed the starting gun.
\
{couplet}
\
run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking,
racing around to come up behind you again.
The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.
\
{refrain}
\
Ev'ry year is geting shorter, never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way. 
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say.
