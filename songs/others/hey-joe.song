Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said where you goin' with that gun in your hand?
Alright. I'm goin down to shoot my old lady,
you know I caught her messin' 'round with another man.
Yeah,! I'm goin' down to shoot my old lady,
you know I caught her messin' 'round with another man.
Huh! And that ain't too cool.
\
Uh, hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down,

Uh, hey Joe, I heard you shot you old lady down,

Yes, I did, I shot her,
you know I caught her messin' 'round,
messin' 'round town.

And I gave her the gun and I shot her!
