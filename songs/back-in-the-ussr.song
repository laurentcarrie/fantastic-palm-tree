[B;Flew] in from Miami Beach B[E;O]AC, [D;Didn't] get to bed last [E;night]

{couplet 2}
Been away so long I hardly knew the place, Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case, Honey disconnect the phone, I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the US, Back in the US, Back in the USSR
{refrain 1}
Well the [E;U]kraine girls really [E;knock] me out

{guitare balalaika E}
Oh, show me round your snow peaked
Mountain way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the USSR
Hey, you don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR
Oh, let me tell you honey
