\lyrics couplet
Yeah
I can't believe the news today
Oh, I can't close my eyes
And make it go away

\lyrics pont 1
How long
How long must we sing this song
How long, how long
Cause tonight {couplet}, we can be as one
Tonight
Broken bottles under children's feet

\lyrics cool
Bodies strewn across the dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

\lyrics pont 2
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody sunday

\lyrics 8 mesures dures, sans chant violon

\lyrics couplet
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
The trench is dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters
Torn apart
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

\lyrics pont 1
How long
How long must we sing this song
How long, how long

\lyrics dur
Cause tonight, we can be as one
Tonight, tonight. Tonight, tonight
Sunday, Bloody Sunday
Sunday, Bloody Sunday

\lyrics couplet
Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
{guitare etouffee}
Oh, wipe your tears away
Oh, wipe your tears away
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Oh, wipe your blood shot eyes
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
\
{pont 2, 2 fois}
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
Sunday, Bloody Sunday (Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
\
And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and TV reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
\
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday)
\
The real battle just begun
To claim the victory Jesus won
On
\
Sunday Bloody Sunday
Sunday Bloody Sunday
